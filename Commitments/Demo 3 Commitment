* The goal: We should be able to:
- Optimize parsing speed. Cut down at least by 30 sec from 52 sec
- Upload CSV Data into database
- Being able use Java to work with SQL
- Load CSV only once for all

* Features and the reason:
- Upload CSV into database:
* Cut down loading time for user to read a CSV file for future use.
